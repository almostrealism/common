## 1. The goal

Resume the redesign to get a **real-time `AudioScene` rendering pipeline** with four
properties:

1. **Batched pattern rendering compatible with real-time generation**, including live
   *swapping* of the `Genome` that decides which elements are on the timeline — when the
   genome changes, the arrangement is re-rendered on the fly without tearing down the
   pipeline.
2. **All DSP defined by PDSL files** — the `MixdownManager` / `EfxManager` signal path
   expressed declaratively, not hand-wired in Java.
3. **Acoustic parity with the last released version** — the redesigned pipeline must
   approximately reproduce the behavior of the released system this work starts from.
4. **Near-enough to real-time** that we can start reasoning about the trade-offs needed
   to get *under* ratio-of-1.

The headline performance target is **ratio-of-1**: render time per tick ≤ the audio
duration of that tick. At 44.1 kHz with a 4096-frame tick the budget is **~92.9 ms/tick**.
We are chasing *keep-up*, not sub-millisecond latency.

## 2. Where we are now (the short version)

The picture is more nuanced than "two of three concerns solved." The a2 batching
*mechanism* is proven, but its *integration into the full real-scene render path* is not,
and a cross-cutting compile-reuse gap (kernel-pool exhaustion) now sits in front of any
full-scene work.

| Concern | Status |
|---|---|
| **a2 batching — the mechanism** (per-note rendering was ~89% of the cost, ~99.4% of it JNI dispatch) | **PROVEN.** Graph batching collapses N per-note `evaluate()` calls into one dispatch per pattern-layer per tick. Wired (`PatternLayerManager.enableBatched` / `AR_PATTERN_BATCHED`). Re-verified (M1) on the *synthetic* sentinel path: dispatch fires, output matches per-note within <1% RMS, 3000 sustained dispatches, ~12× under the per-tick budget for the pattern layer in isolation. See §2 verification below. |
| **a2 batching — real-scene integration** | **OPEN.** On the full curated-library scene, batched dispatch does **not** reliably fire for the real pattern path (some methods render `peak=0.0` / silence), and full-scene renders exhaust the native kernel pool (next row). The full-scene test `BatchedRealSceneRenderTest` is `@Ignore`d for this reason. This is integration/scaling work, *not* a defect in the batching kernel. |
| **Compile-reuse / `GeneratedOperation` pool** | **OPEN (cross-cutting blocker).** Structurally-identical computations recompile instead of reusing a cached kernel because argument-aggregation-target buffers have a `null` signature; each rebuild consumes a slot from a fixed pool. The pool was expanded (to `GeneratedOperation5999`) as a **stopgap, not a fix**. See [../SIGNATURE_AGGREGATION_GAP.md](../SIGNATURE_AGGREGATION_GAP.md). |
| **Metal dispatch ceiling** (host wedged forever past ~2300–2560 cumulative dispatches) | **SOLVED.** Fixed and merged; 3000+ sustained Metal dispatches verified, re-confirmed (M1) by the sustained-dispatch sentinel test. See [METAL_SUSTAINED_DISPATCH.md](METAL_SUSTAINED_DISPATCH.md). |
| **a3 — frame-buffer DSP/mixdown** | **MIGRATED TO PDSL, parity validated by ear, and AT RATIO-OF-1 (2026-06-12).** The full mixdown/efx/reverb DSP runs as one compiled PDSL model per buffer (`mixdown_master_wet`). After the dispatch-fragmentation fix (§5), the PDSL tick is 177–231 ms vs the 185.76 ms budget at 8192 frames (0.80–1.05×) — faster than the CellList tick (300–369 ms). Acoustic gaps are accepted approximations, inventoried in [PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md](PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md). |

**Verified (M1, 2026-06-09) — synthetic sentinel path, `studio/music`:** the batched
pattern mechanism fires and is correct in isolation. `BatchedDispatchSentinelTest`
(`batchedDispatchCount=1, fallback=0`), `BatchedVsPerNoteRmsTest` (relative RMS 0.31% vs
per-note, non-silent), `BatchedRealtimeTickTest` (equivalence relative RMS 0.65%;
sustained run: **3000 dispatches, 0 fallback, non-silent, avg 7.76 ms/tick vs 92.9 ms
budget → ratio ≈ 0.084** at 4096-frame buffers, drift stable). These use *synthetic*
`FileNoteSource` inputs — they validate the kernel/dispatch, not the full scene.

**Historical (M4, 2026-06-03) — real curated library, full fx/mixdown, default hybrid
routing.** *The library is now present on the M1 (real-scene PDSL A/B and benchmark run
against it), but `BatchedRealSceneRenderTest` itself remains `@Ignore`d on the
compile-reuse blocker, so these specific batched-path figures are still M4-historical.*
- All 6 channels rendered **real, non-silent audio** end-to-end; a 5-minute continuous
  render completed near real-time (**~1.1× the budget at 4096–8192-frame buffers**) with
  bounded memory.
- A profile attributed **99.6% of the tick to a single operation: `f_loop_7651`
  "Loop ×4096 [JNI]"** — the per-frame mixdown loop, running on CPU.

**Hard constraints learned the hard way:**
1. **Real-time requires HYBRID routing — never force `AR_HARDWARE_DRIVER`.** The
   framework uses JNI (CPU) and Metal *together*. Forcing `mtl` fails to compile the
   mixdown loop (Metal's 31-buffer-argument-per-kernel limit); forcing `native` is
   ~14× slower. The default (unset) router splits work correctly. See
   [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
2. **Continuous rendering requires `-DAR_PATTERN_CACHE_PERSIST=true`.** Without it,
   native memory leaks (~150 MB/buffer) and the per-tick ratio explodes from ~1.1× to
   70×+ before OOM. It is a `static final` read at class load, so it must be a JVM
   `-D` arg.
3. **Full-scene renders need the compile-reuse gap closed (or worked around).** Until
   structurally-identical kernels are cached rather than recompiled, every fresh scene
   build burns kernel-pool slots and eventually exhausts them, cascading into unrelated
   `AudioScene` test failures. See [../SIGNATURE_AGGREGATION_GAP.md](../SIGNATURE_AGGREGATION_GAP.md).

## 3. The three layers, and the target shape

The redesign target is three layers with very different economics, decoupled by
ring buffers so each runs on its own clock:

| Layer | Job | Cost | Horizon | Home |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **a1 — pattern generation** | decide *which* notes exist (positions, pitch, ADSR, automation) | cheap | minutes | `PatternLayerManager.sumInternal` (scheduling half) |
| **a2 — per-note rendering** | synthesize each note's samples (resample + envelopes) | costly, **now batched** | seconds | `BatchedPatternLayerRenderer` → `BatchedPatternRenderer` |
| **a3 — frame-buffer rendering** | mix live notes into N frames and play them | **most sensitive — the bottleneck** | just-in-time | `MixdownManager`/`EfxManager` → `BufferedOutputScheduler` |

**Diagram A — the target (three layers, three clocks, two rings):**

```
   horizon: MINUTES            horizon: ~SECONDS            horizon: NOW (just-in-time)
   cadence: rare / on-edit     cadence: every few buffers   cadence: every audio buffer
   grain:   whole arrangement  grain:   a window of notes    grain:   one frame-buffer
   cost:    cheap              cost:    costly (batched)      cost:    must beat the clock

   ┌──────────────────┐    ┌────────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────┐

       [ schedule buf ] ─────────▶ [ audio ring buf ] ─────────▶ [ speaker ]
                  back-pressure ◀── pacing ◀── playback clock ◀── BufferedOutputScheduler gap

   INVARIANTS: a3 is the only layer bound to the real-time clock; a1/a2 run AHEAD and
   never block a3. Each seam is a buffer, so each layer has its own grain and cadence.
```

**Where we actually are vs. Diagram A:** the *old* state fused a1+a2 into one
synchronous per-buffer call with N JNI dispatches and no ring before a3. The a2
batching work collapsed the N dispatches into one (the proven 100–1500× win), so the
synthesis cost is no longer the wall. What remains to fully reach Diagram A:
**(1)** decouple a1/a2/a3 onto independent clocks via rolling buffers (today
pattern audio is bulk-rendered once in `setup`, not streamed seconds-ahead), and
**(2)** move a3 (the DSP loop) onto the PDSL substrate so it can be optimized — the
subject of the next phase.

## 4. What has landed

- **a2 batching (the mechanism).** `PatternFeatures.render` routes through
  `BatchedPatternLayerRenderer` when `enableBatched` is set; melodic-SSS fused kernel +
  accumulate-reduce, buckets `{16,32,64,128,256,512}`, `destOffsets[]` scatter placement,
  resample-as-producer. Sentinel discipline (`batchedDispatchCount>0`,
  `fallbackCount==0`). Evidence: [PATTERN_RENDERING_FLOOR.md](PATTERN_RENDERING_FLOOR.md);
  design-as-built: [NOTE_GRAPH_SHAPES.md](NOTE_GRAPH_SHAPES.md). **Caveat:** validated on
  the synthetic sentinel path only — real-scene integration is open work (see §2 and §5).
- **Metal sustained dispatch.** [METAL_SUSTAINED_DISPATCH.md](METAL_SUSTAINED_DISPATCH.md).
- **Real-time streaming substrate (a3 plumbing).** `AudioScene.runnerRealTime`,
  `BufferedOutputScheduler` (gap/back-pressure/degraded-mode), `warmNoteCache`,
  `consolidateRenderBuffers`. The output side is largely solved.
- **The PDSL audio DSP substrate (merged to master).** This is the foundation the
  next phase builds on:
  - **Primitives:** `fir`, `scale`, `identity`, `lowpass`, `highpass`, `biquad`,
    `delay`, `lfo`, and **`delay_network`** (multi-tap feedback reverb — *implemented*,
    `AudioDspPrimitives.java` / `MultiChannelDspFeatures.delayNetworkBlock`).
  - **Multi-channel constructs:** `channels:` header, `for each channel { }`,
    `repeat(N)`, `route(matrix)` (square *or* rectangular), `sum_channels()`,
    `accum_blocks(...)`. Per-channel kernel splitting falls out of how `for each
    channel` compiles — no graph-analysis pass needed.
  - **Producer-valued args:** every primitive the live system drives with a
    `Producer` (volume, cutoffs, delay time, automation) accepts `producer([shape])`;
    bound at dispatch via `PdslPrimitiveContext.toProducer`. Literal calls compile
    identically to before.
  - **PDSL files** (`engine/ml/src/main/resources/pdsl/audio/`): `efx_channel.pdsl`,
    `mixdown_channel.pdsl`, `delay_feedback_bank.pdsl`, `mixdown_manager.pdsl`.
  - **Adapter + tests:** `MixdownManagerPdslAdapter` (`buildArgsMap`,
    `wrapBlockAsCellList`), `MixdownManagerPdslTest` / `MixdownManagerPdslVerificationTest`.
  Full inventory and the row-by-row migration map: [PDSL_AUDIO_DSP.md](PDSL_AUDIO_DSP.md).

## 5. The next phase — migrate the DSP loop to PDSL

**Why:** a3 (the per-frame mixdown/effects loop) is now the bottleneck, it is
frame-recurrent stateful DSP (biquad/delay/reverb state carried frame→frame) that
cannot parallelize across time, and it is hand-wired as a `MixdownManager`/`EfxManager`
`CellList`. Re-expressing it in PDSL puts it in front of the same ML-model optimization
tooling we use elsewhere — so we can attack it (parallelize across channels/voices,
split recurrent from non-recurrent ops onto Metal, block-process where the recurrence
allows) instead of being stuck with one sequential JNI loop.

**Blockers in front of full-scene work (do these first):**
- **Compile-reuse / kernel-pool exhaustion.** Structurally-identical computations
  recompile rather than reuse a cached kernel (null signature on argument-aggregation
  targets), so each scene rebuild consumes `GeneratedOperation` slots until the pool is
  exhausted and unrelated `AudioScene` tests start failing. The pool expansion shipped so
  far is a stopgap. A real fix (valid signatures for aggregation targets, or gating
  aggregation) is prerequisite to re-enabling `BatchedRealSceneRenderTest` and to any
  sustained full-scene render. See [../SIGNATURE_AGGREGATION_GAP.md](../SIGNATURE_AGGREGATION_GAP.md).
- **a2 real-scene dispatch.** Batched dispatch fires on synthetic notes but not reliably
  on the real curated-library pattern path (some methods render `peak=0.0`). Make batched
  dispatch fire for every production note shape — the a1→a2 seam is "classify-and-dispatch"
  over a closed set of shapes (see §7 and [NOTE_GRAPH_SHAPES.md](NOTE_GRAPH_SHAPES.md)),
  so an unhandled real shape silently falls through to silence.
- ~~Curated library on this machine~~ — **resolved:** `/Users/Shared/Music/Samples`
  (~6k WAVs) and a valid `pattern-factory.json` are present on the M1; all real-scene
  tests run (they skip gracefully where the library is absent, e.g. CI).

**The cutover itself — DONE (2026-06-11, this branch): parity reached.**
`AudioSceneRealtimeRunner` houses both strategies behind
`MixdownManager.enablePdslMixdown` (`AR_PDSL_MIXDOWN`, default off): the established
CellList path and a Block-forward PDSL path (pattern prep unchanged; one compiled
`mixdown_master_wet` forward per buffer; output streamed to the master line; never
`wrapBlockAsCellList`). Level/sweep parity on the full 40s real-scene A/B with a
faithful reverb-ON control was validated by ear by the owner: windowed RMS ratios
0.88–1.03, overall 0.94–0.99, sweeps tracking, deterministic re-render via persisted
`scene-settings.json` + fixed genome seed (`AudioScenePdslCutoverTest.realSceneAbReview`).
The defect history (six masking defects) and durable lessons:
[EFX_PDSL_PARITY_PLAN.md](EFX_PDSL_PARITY_PLAN.md). The complete inventory of remaining
(accepted) path differences and their swap impact:
[PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md](PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md).

**Outstanding work (the actual to-do list):**
- **PDSL tick performance — FIXED (2026-06-11/12): ratio-of-1 reached at 8192.**
  The PDSL full tick was ≈1.9 s vs the CellList's ≈0.3 s. Root cause (confirmed by
  thread dumps, not the profile — the cost was invisible to OperationProfile): the
  `delay_network` ring update was composed from per-channel subset/mask/concat trees
  that `Process.optimize` fragmented into hundreds of `IsolatedProcess` stages, and
  every forward evaluated them serially — each one a dispatch plus a synchronous
  completion-latch wait (`ProcessDetailsFactory.construct` →
  `DestinationEvaluable.request` → `awaitReady` nesting). Fix: the update is now
  expressed as single computations over the raw state collections (nothing left to
  isolate) — `CollectionSlotUpdateComputation` (new, general: replaces one
  runtime-positioned slot per block; also the KV-cache-update shape) for the ring
  write, plus fused ring-read+routing and head-advance expressions in
  `MultiChannelDspFeatures`. One subtlety: the fused in-place ring write needed an
  explicit one-op materialization of the new frame (the old fragmentation had been
  *accidentally* providing it), caught by `DelayNetworkBehaviorTest.test11`.
  Results (M1, `studio/compose/results/pdsl-cutover/benchmark.txt`): reverb bus
  forward 1382 ms → 3.2 ms; full `mixdown_master_wet` forward 3463 ms → 77 ms;
  production PDSL tick 177–231 ms vs the 185.76 ms budget (0.80–1.05× — the densest
  genome is at ratio-of-1) and now FASTER than the CellList tick (300–369 ms).
  Remaining: a ~100–150 ms fixed per-tick cost (pattern prep ≈66 ms + residual
  stages) keeps 4096-frame ticks at 0.64×; shaving it is the next increment.
- **Lean pattern prep.** `createPdsl` still builds the unused Java mixdown CellList as
  a side effect of reusing `getCells` for pattern preparation. Build-time-only cost
  (PDSL build ≈52 s vs CellList ≈70 s — the PDSL build already skips compiling the
  CellList's tick loop); worth removing, but it is not the tick-rate problem.
- **True stereo.** The PDSL path is dual-mono (one master duplicated to both writers).
  Stereo is a real, expected feature (stereo samples with distinct L/R must carry
  through independently) and must be one model carrying twice the channels in a
  *single* forward — never the pipeline run twice (that attempt was reverted).
- **Flip the default.** `enablePdslMixdown` is off by default; turning it on for
  production (ringsdesktop) awaits the swap-impact review
  ([PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md](PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md) §7) and CI.
- **Gene HP/LP `choice()` in compiled models.** The efx gene filter renders LP-only
  until PDSL supports `choice(...)` inside a compiled graph.
- **Per-frame automation (only if ever audible).** Automation steps per buffer
  (~186 ms at 8192); production envelopes are slow enough that this is inaudible.
- **Live genome swapping (goal #1) — mechanism exists, correctness partially open.**
  `AudioSceneMultiGenomeTest.multiGenomeFullRunner` swaps genomes on a live runner
  (memory-stability validated); `AudioScenePdslBenchmarkTest` exercises the same
  protocol on the PDSL path. Open: validating the swap's *audio* correctness under
  continuous live output, and the build-time-sampled argument staleness
  ([PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md](PDSL_SIGNAL_PATH_DIFFERENCES.md) §5 — wet/efx
  filter coefficient banks lag the genome until rebuild).
- **Variable channel count.** PDSL `channels` is fixed at block-build time; gene-driven
  channel activation is still Java. The runner guards: selections that are not a
  zero-based contiguous prefix of size ≥ 2 fall back to the CellList path.
- **a1/a2/a3 ring decoupling** (to reach Diagram A): make `PatternAudioBuffer` rolling,
  run a2 on a worker K buffers ahead, point a3 at PDSL `Block`s pumped by
  `BufferedOutputScheduler`.

**The confirmation question this phase had to answer — HALF ANSWERED (2026-06-11):**
*can all signal processing be expressed in PDSL with acoustic parity and at/under the
real-time budget?* **Parity: YES** — validated by ear + windowed RMS on the full
real-scene A/B. **Budget: NOT YET** — the full PDSL tick runs ~10× over budget on the
M1 (vs ~1.6–2× for the CellList tick), dominated by a constant per-tick overhead that
is independent of buffer size and pattern density (see the benchmark item above). The
expressiveness question is settled; the remaining work is engineering the constant out
of the tick, not re-architecting the DSP.

## 6. Options that are moot

The original redesign framed the DSP problem as a choice among hand-built CellList
architectures (A: channel-scoped CellLists; B: flat-buffer pipeline; C:
hybrid + graph-analysis copy-elimination; D: stream-oriented). **PDSL is the answer to
all of them** — `for each channel` gives per-channel kernels, the Block model
eliminates the Cell/CachedStateCell copy chain, and the declarative expression tree
makes a graph-analysis pass unnecessary. Do not revive these; build on PDSL.

## 7. Durable lessons (don't re-derive)

- **Expression-level micro-optimization of GPU kernels is futile** — the native
  compiler already does LICM/strength-reduction/CSE; hand-factoring the expression tree
  produced zero measurable kernel-time change. (From the loop-optimization journal, now
  retired.)
- **Do NOT apply `Process.optimized()` to the per-note / flat-pipeline chain** — it
  *added* ~15% overhead. The optimizer is for graphs with isolation/reuse targets, not
  flat pipelines.
- **The a1→a2 seam is "classify-and-dispatch," not "compile an arbitrary graph"** —
  production notes are a tiny closed set of shapes. The prior attempt failed by assuming
  one source per note (`innermostAudio()`) when every real note is a 3-source merge.
