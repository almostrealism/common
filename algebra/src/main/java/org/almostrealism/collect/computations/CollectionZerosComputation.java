/**
 * A {@link CollectionZerosComputation} represents a computation that produces a 
 * {@link PackedCollection} where every element is zero (0.0). This is a specialized
 * and highly optimized implementation for creating zero-filled collections, which are
 * fundamental building blocks in linear algebra and numerical computing.
 * 
 * <p>This class extends {@link CollectionConstantComputation} and provides the most
 * efficient implementation for zero-valued collections. It includes extensive optimizations
 * for algebraic operations where zero operands allow for significant simplifications,
 * such as multiplication by zero yielding zero, and addition with zero being a no-op.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Examples:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create a zero vector
 * TraversalPolicy vectorShape = new TraversalPolicy(5);
 * CollectionZerosComputation<PackedCollection> zeroVector = 
 *     new CollectionZerosComputation<>(vectorShape);
 * PackedCollection result = zeroVector.get().evaluate();
 * // result: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
 * 
 * // Create a zero matrix
 * TraversalPolicy matrixShape = new TraversalPolicy(3, 4);
 * CollectionZerosComputation<PackedCollection> zeroMatrix = 
 *     new CollectionZerosComputation<>(matrixShape);
 * PackedCollection matrix = zeroMatrix.get().evaluate();
 * // result: 3x4 matrix filled with zeros
 * 
 * // Create a 3D tensor of zeros
 * TraversalPolicy tensorShape = new TraversalPolicy(2, 3, 4);
 * CollectionZerosComputation<PackedCollection> zeroTensor = 
 *     new CollectionZerosComputation<>(tensorShape);
 * // result: 2x3x4 tensor with all 24 elements as 0.0
 * 
 * // Using with CollectionFeatures
 * CollectionProducer<PackedCollection<?>> zeros = zeros(shape(10));
 * PackedCollection result = zeros.get().evaluate();
 * // result: 10-element vector of zeros
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Optimizations:</h3>
 * <p>This class provides several key optimizations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Zero Detection</strong> - {@link #isZero()} always returns true, enabling
 *       algebraic simplifications throughout the computation pipeline</li>
 *   <li><strong>Multiplication Optimization</strong> - Any multiplication involving a zero
 *       collection can be replaced with another zero collection</li>
 *   <li><strong>Addition Optimization</strong> - Adding zero collections is optimized to
 *       return the non-zero operand directly</li>
 *   <li><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong> - No storage of actual zero values; the computation
 *       generates zeros on demand</li>
 *   <li><strong>Shape Operations</strong> - Reshape and traverse operations are highly efficient
 *       as they only modify metadata without affecting the zero content</li>
 *   <li><strong>Delta Operations</strong> - Derivatives of zero functions remain zero,
 *       enabling optimization in calculus operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Mathematical Properties:</h3>
 * <p>Zero collections have special mathematical properties that enable optimizations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Additive Identity</strong>: A + 0 = A for any collection A</li>
 *   <li><strong>Multiplicative Zero</strong>: A × 0 = 0 for any collection A</li>
 *   <li><strong>Derivative Property</strong>: d/dx(0) = 0</li>
 *   <li><strong>Sum Property</strong>: sum(zeros) = 0</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Common Use Cases:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Initializing collections to a known state</li>
 *   <li>Creating padding or boundary conditions</li>
 *   <li>Representing empty or null spaces in algorithms</li>
 *   <li>Serving as identity elements in additive operations</li>
 *   <li>Implementing sparse data structures</li>
 *   <li>Creating baseline values for gradient computations</li>
 * </ul>
