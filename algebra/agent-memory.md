# Algebra Module Agent Memory

## Collection Computations

### CollectionSumComputation
- Primary implementation for element-wise addition of PackedCollection instances
- Extends TransitiveDeltaExpressionComputation for automatic differentiation support
- Used internally by CollectionFeatures.add() methods
- Supports variable number of operands through varargs constructors
- Key methods:
  - `getExpression()`: Creates sum expression using ExpressionFeatures.sum()
  - `generate()`: Creates CollectionProducerParallelProcess for hardware execution
- Examples and usage patterns documented in comprehensive javadoc
- Optimized for parallel execution and hardware acceleration

## Documentation Standards Applied
- Comprehensive class-level javadoc with usage examples
- Detailed constructor documentation explaining parameter purposes
- Method-level javadoc explaining implementation details and process flow
- Cross-references to related classes and interfaces using @link
- Examples demonstrate practical usage patterns
- Performance considerations and optimization notes included
