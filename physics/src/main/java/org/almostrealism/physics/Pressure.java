/**
 * Represents pressure in a physical simulation.
 * <p>
 * This class is a placeholder for pressure-related functionality in the physics module.
 * Pressure is a fundamental physical quantity representing force per unit area, typically
 * measured in Pascals (Pa) or atmospheres (atm).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Atmospheric pressure simulation</li>
 *   <li>Gas dynamics and thermodynamics</li>
 *   <li>Fluid pressure calculations</li>
 *   <li>Sound wave propagation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Units</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Pascal (Pa)</b> - SI unit: 1 Pa = 1 N/m^2</li>
 *   <li><b>Atmosphere (atm)</b> - 1 atm = 101,325 Pa</li>
 *   <li><b>Bar</b> - 1 bar = 100,000 Pa</li>
 * </ul>
